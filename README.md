Hi

I am learniong HTML and CSS (I am currently learning JavaScript now). I created a test website to test my HTML and CSS skills using a lot of different options with HTML and CSS.

A lot to improve needs to be done, but my progress is coming really fast!

BTW: Website will not look good on phones ðŸ˜«

Here the link of the Website: https://portfoliohtmlandcss.000webhostapp.com/
